# Legacy Responsive Web Design

In this __Responsive Web Design Certification__, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.


## Basic HTML and HTML5

HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.

In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements â€” the building blocks of any webpage.

```
Hue: A pure pigment.

Tint: A pure pigment with just white added.
Shade: a pure pigment with just black added.
```
> Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

> The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.

> Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:
```
red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)
```

> This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing).

> There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.

> Note: Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. This issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.

- [x] Learn about Tertiary Colors

> Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

> Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

> There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

> Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:

```
Color	    Hex Code
orange	    #FF7F00
cyan	    #00FFFF
raspberry	#FF007F
```

- [x] Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors

> The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.


- [x] Adjust the Hue of a Color

> Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() function as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

> Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.

> Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

> Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

> Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

```
Color	HSL
red	hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
yellow	hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
green	hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
cyan	hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue	hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta	hsl(300, 100%, 50%)
```

- [x] Adjust the Tone of a Color

> The `hsl()` option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of `hsl()` stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.

> **All elements have a default `background-color` of transparent. Our `element` currently appears to have a `color` background, because the element behind it has a `background-color` set to `color`.**


- [x] Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient

> Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:

```background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);```
> The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a horizontal gradient (from left to right) and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

> Example:

```background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));```

- [x] Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element
> The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.

> The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.

> In the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels away from the beginning of the gradient.

> For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.

`0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px`
> If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.

- [x] Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image

> One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground. The background property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.

- [x] Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element

> To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:
```
p {
  transform: scale(2);
}
```

- [x] Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover

> The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

> Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:
```
p:hover {
  transform: scale(2.1);
}
```
> Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.

- [x] Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis

> The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

>The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.
```
p {
  transform: skewX(-32deg);
}
```

- [x] Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis

> Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

- [x] Create a Graphic Using CSS

> By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

> You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.

> In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.

> You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

- [x] Create a More Complex Shape Using CSS and HTML

> One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS. But first, you need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element; ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class heart:
```
.heart::before {
  content: "";
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 25%;
  position: absolute;
  height: 50px;
  width: 70px;
  top: -50px;
  left: 5px;
}
```
> For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined content property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string. In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border-radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

- [x] Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work

> To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

> animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

> animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

> @keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:
```
#anim {
  animation-name: colorful;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}

@keyframes colorful {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
```
> For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.



- [x] Use CSS Animation to Change the Hover State of a Button

> You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

> ere's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:

```
<style>
  img {
    width: 30px;
  }
  img:hover {
    animation-name: width;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
  }

  @keyframes width {
    100% {
      width: 40px;
    }
  }
</style>
```

`<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/applied-visual-design/google-logo.png" alt="Google's Logo" />`

> Note that ms stands for milliseconds, where 1000ms is equal to 1s.


- [x] Modify Fill Mode of an Animation

> That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.

> This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:

`animation-fill-mode: forwards;`


- [x] Create Movement Using CSS Animation

> When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.

> As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the `50%` keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.
```
@keyframes rainbow {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
    top: 0px;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: green;
    top: 50px;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
    top: 0px;
  }
}
```

- [x] Create Visual Direction by Fading an Element from Left to Right

> For this challenge, you'll change the `opacity` of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

> In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the `@keyframes` rule.

> Target the element with the id of `ball and add the opacity property set to 0.1 at 50%, so the element fades as it moves to the right.

- [x] Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count

> The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the `@keyframes` rule. Another animation property is the `animation-iteration-count`, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

`animation-iteration-count: 3;`

> In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to `infinite`.

> To keep the ball bouncing on the right on a continuous loop, change the `animation-iteration-count` property to `infinite`.

- [x] Make a CSS Heartbeat using an Infinite Animation Count

> Here's one more continuous animation example with the animation-iteration-count property that uses the heart you designed in a previous challenge.

> The one-second long heartbeat animation consists of two animated pieces. The heart elements (including the :before and :after pieces) are animated to change size using the transform property, and the background div is animated to change its color using the background property.

- [x] Animate Elements at Variable Rates

> There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. So far, this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

> To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two stars that each decrease in size and opacity at the 20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements so the stars twinkle at different rates.
