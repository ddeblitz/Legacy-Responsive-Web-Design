# Legacy Responsive Web Design

In this __Responsive Web Design Certification__, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.


## Basic HTML and HTML5
HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.

In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements â€” the building blocks of any webpage.

##  Basic CSS

Now that you've described the structure of your cat photo app, give it some style with CSS.
