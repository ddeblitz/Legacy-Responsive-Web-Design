# Legacy Responsive Web Design

In this __Responsive Web Design Certification__, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML
(Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS
variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with
Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.


## Basic HTML and HTML5

HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different
elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.

In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements â€” the building blocks of any
webpage.

## Applied Visual Design

Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver
your unique message.

In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages.

Hue: A pure pigment.
Tone: A pure pigment with just grey added.
Tint: A pure pigment with just white added.
Shade: a pure pigment with just black added.
```
Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a
website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of
colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with
your content.

The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are
neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called
complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a
gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.

Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:
```
red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)
```

This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary
and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the
subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing).

There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.

Note: Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. However, color alone should not be used as the
only way to convey important information because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. This
issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.

### - Learn about Tertiary Colors

Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is
known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary
colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw
these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary
color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is
made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example,
within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a
simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example
that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then
pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a
design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:

```
Color Hex Code
orange #FF7F00
cyan #00FFFF
raspberry #FF007F
```

### - Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors

The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more
vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and
can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the
colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.


### - Adjust the Hue of a Color

Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() function as an
alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left,
moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses
a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0
and 360.

Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color
is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white),
where 50% is the normal color.

Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

```
Color HSL
red hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
yellow hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
green hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
cyan hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta hsl(300, 100%, 50%)
```

### - Adjust the Tone of a Color

The `hsl()` option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint
of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting
and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of `hsl()` stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation
percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is
useful when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.

**All elements have a default `background-color` of transparent. Our `element` currently appears to have a `color`
background, because the element behind it has a `background-color` set to `color`.**


### - Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient

Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions,
otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient()
function. Here is the general syntax:

```background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);```
The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where
90deg makes a horizontal gradient (from left to right) and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top
right). The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

Example:

```background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));```

### - Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element
The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats
the specified gradient pattern. repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work
with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.

The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes
place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.

In the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into
the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient
immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels
away from the beginning of the gradient.

For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.

`0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px`
If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color,
followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.

### - Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image

One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is
balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground. The background
property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is
wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.

### - Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element

To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code
example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:
```
p {
transform: scale(2);
}
```

### - Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover

The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used
with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add
interactivity to your elements.

Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:
```
p:hover {
transform: scale(2.1);
}
```
Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.

### - Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis

The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis
by a given degree.

>The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.
```
p {
transform: skewX(-32deg);
}
```

### - Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis

Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that
the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

### - Create a Graphic Using CSS

By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a
crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an
element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is
actually going to be the moon shape you see.

In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.

You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius,
spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

### - Create a More Complex Shape Using CSS and HTML

One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS.
But first, you need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. ::before creates a pseudo-element that is
the first child of the selected element; ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected
element. In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class
heart:
```
.heart::before {
content: "";
background-color: yellow;
border-radius: 25%;
position: absolute;
height: 50px;
width: 70px;
top: -50px;
left: 5px;
}
```
For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined content property. This
property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the ::before and ::after
pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string. In the
above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with
height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border-radius and is
positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

### - Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work

To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties
control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are
eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which
animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS
properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to
a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how
the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over
the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation
properties:
```
#anim {
animation-name: colorful;
animation-duration: 3s;
}

@keyframes colorful {
0% {
background-color: blue;
}
100% {
background-color: yellow;
}
}
```
For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the
animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It
sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the
animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any
percentage between 0% and 100%.



### - Use CSS Animation to Change the Hover State of a Button

You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

ere's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:

```
<style>
  img {
    width: 30px;
  }

  img:hover {
    animation-name: width;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
  }

  @keyframes width {
    100% {
      width: 40px;
    }
  }
</style>
```

`<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/applied-visual-design/google-logo.png" alt="Google's Logo" />`

Note that ms stands for milliseconds, where 1000ms is equal to 1s.


### - Modify Fill Mode of an Animation

That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button
to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.

This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style
applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:

`animation-fill-mode: forwards;`


### - Create Movement Using CSS Animation

When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and
bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.

As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the `50%`
keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.
```
@keyframes rainbow {
0% {
background-color: blue;
top: 0px;
}
50% {
background-color: green;
top: 50px;
}
100% {
background-color: yellow;
top: 0px;
}
}
```

### - Create Visual Direction by Fading an Element from Left to Right

For this challenge, you'll change the `opacity` of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right
side of the screen.

In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the
animation per the `@keyframes` rule.

Target the element with the id of `ball and add the opacity property set to 0.1 at 50%, so the element fades as it moves
to the right.

### - Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count

The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the `@keyframes` rule. Another animation
property is the `animation-iteration-count`, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through
the animation. Here's an example:

`animation-iteration-count: 3;`

In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by
setting that value to `infinite`.

To keep the ball bouncing on the right on a continuous loop, change the `animation-iteration-count` property to
`infinite`.

### - Make a CSS Heartbeat using an Infinite Animation Count

Here's one more continuous animation example with the animation-iteration-count property that uses the heart you
designed in a previous challenge.

The one-second long heartbeat animation consists of two animated pieces. The heart elements (including the :before and
:after pieces) are animated to change size using the transform property, and the background div is animated to change
its color using the background property.

### - Animate Elements at Variable Rates

There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. So far, this has been achieved
by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two stars that each decrease in size and opacity at the 20% mark
in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements
so the stars twinkle at different rates.

### - Animate Multiple Elements at Variable Rates

In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their
@keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

In the animation running in the code editor, there are three stars in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a
continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different
values for each element.

### - Change Animation Timing with Keywords

In CSS animations, the `animation-timing-function` property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the
duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your
`animation-duration`), the `animation-timing-function` says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of
the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is `ease`, **which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end.**
Other options include
`ease-out`, **which is quick in the beginning then slows down**,
`ease-in`, **which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end**, or
`linear`, **which applies a constant animation speed throughout**.

### - Learn How Bezier Curves Work

The last challenge introduced the animation-timing-function property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.

In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the
animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration
of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.

The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0 and p3 are
set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1,
1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the
curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points
in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

`animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);`

In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you
remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear
change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the linear keyword. In other words, it
changes at a constant speed.

### - Use a Bezier Curve to Move a Graphic

A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then
slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element)
and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be
achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the
animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:

`animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);``

Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve
moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves
through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element
progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship
between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from
0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.

### - Make Motion More Natural Using a Bezier Curve

This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the
linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize
a Bezier curve for this.

The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to
infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two
identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

`cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);``

Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on a 1 by 1 coordinate system,
and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a
bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.



## Applied Accessibility
### - Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility

You've likely seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. alt text describes the image's content and
provides a text-alternative for it. An alt attribute helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a
user. Search engines also use it to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an
example:

`<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">`

People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get
information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its
contents to deliver key information.

Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your
image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.

### - Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank

In the last challenge, you learned that including an alt attribute when using img tags is mandatory. However, sometimes
images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. In these cases, alt text may
seem redundant or unnecessary.

When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt
attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:

`<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">`

Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules,
and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.

Note: For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text since it helps search engines catalog the
image's content.

### - Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content

Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen
readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the
heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size
values.

Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains.

If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the
conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline. It should be its own section. Similarly, the heading tags in a
webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content.

Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the
previous one.

As an example, a page with an `h2` element followed by several subsections labeled with `h4` elements would confuse a
screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use
CSS to edit the relative sizing.

One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which is the main subject of your content.
This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.

### - Jump Straight to the Content Using the main Element

HTML5 introduced several new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features.
These tags include `main`, `header`, ``footer``, `nav`, `article`, and `section`, among others.

By default, a browser renders these elements similar to the humble `div`. However, using them where appropriate gives
additional meaning to your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds
semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or
navigation options to their users.

The `main` element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the `main` content, and there should be only one per page. It's
meant to surround the information related to your page's central topic. It's not meant to include items that repeat
across pages, like navigation links or banners.

The `main` tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to navigate to the main content
quickly. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using the main tag automatically gives
assistive devices that functionality.

### - Wrap Content in the article Element

`article` is another one of the new HTML5 elements that add semantic meaning to your markup. `article` is a sectioning
element and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or
news articles.

Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgment call, but you can use a couple of simple tests. Ask
yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense? Similarly, for text, would the
content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?

Remember that folks using assistive technologies rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better understand
your work.

Note: The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than `article`. An
`article` is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within
each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no
relationship between groups of content, then use a `div`.

`<div> `- groups content `<section> `- groups related content `<article>` - groups independent, self-contained content

### - Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header Landmark

      The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the `header` tag. It's used to
      wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated
      at the top on multiple pages.

      `header` shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly
      navigate to that content.

      Note: The `header` is meant for use in the `body` tag of your HTML document. It is different than the `head`
      element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

### - Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the nav Landmark

      The `nav` element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This
      tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.

      If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a `nav` tag as
      well. Using a `footer` (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient.

### - Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the footer Landmark

      Similar to `header` and `nav`, the `footer` element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices
      to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that
      usually sit at the bottom of a page.


### - Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element

HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:
```
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

```
Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.
